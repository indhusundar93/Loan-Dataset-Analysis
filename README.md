# Loan-Dataset-Analysis
This project analyzes a loan dataset using Excel, SQL, and Power BI to study customer profiles, loan eligibility, and risk levels. Data cleaning, derived columns, statistical analysis, and DAX measures were applied to create dashboards that support data-driven loan approval and risk management decisions.
This Loan Dataset Analysis project focuses on evaluating customer profiles, loan characteristics, and repayment behavior using data analytics tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The dataset was generated using Mockaroo for analytical practice and consists of 2000 records with 10 attributes, representing customer demographics, financial details, credit scores, loan amounts, interest rates, and loan status. The primary objective of this project is to identify key factors influencing loan eligibility, approval patterns, risk levels, and overall portfolio performance to support data-driven decision-making.

The project began with data preparation and cleaning, where missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicate records were identified and removed. Data types were standardized to ensure accuracy and reliability before analysis. In Excel, multiple derived columns were created using logical formulas to classify loan eligibility, income categories, credit score bands, and income ratios. These transformations helped in segmenting customers and understanding their financial standing more clearly.

The cleaned dataset was then imported into a SQL database for further processing. SQL queries were used for filtering, aggregation, grouping, and segmentation of loan records based on loan status, eligibility, income levels, and credit scores. Aggregate functions such as SUM, AVG, and COUNT enabled efficient summarization of loan amounts and customer data, making the dataset analysis-ready for visualization.

A statistical analysis was conducted to study credit score distribution, where the mean and median values indicated a balanced dataset with wide variation in borrower risk profiles. Trends, patterns, and anomalies were identified, revealing that customers with good and excellent credit scores had higher approval rates, while poor credit score customers holding high loan amounts posed potential risk.

In Power BI, Power Query was used to create conditional and derived columns such as risk levels, interest rate categories, EMI amounts, and total interest amounts. DAX measures were developed to calculate KPIs including total loans issued, active and closed loans, total customers, and average interest rate. Interactive dashboards were designed to visually present insights, enabling quick understanding of loan performance and risk exposure.

Overall, this project demonstrates how data analytics can be effectively used to improve risk management, customer segmentation, and lending strategies, ultimately supporting better financial decision-making.
